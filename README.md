# Predict an Ad's Success
This repository contains my solution for the [Predict an Ad's Success](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/predict-ad-success-hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge/) competition on HackerEarth.

## Development
My solution is implemented in [RapidMiner Studio](https://rapidminer.com/products/studio/). Open the solution by creating a new repository with the path set to the `repository` directory. My solution is implemented in the "Workspace" process. Because of RapidMiner Studio limitations you'll have to manually make sure that the path of the "Write CSV" operator is a valid absolute path.

## Submitting a solution
Submitting a solution should go like this:
1. Ensure the `submission/result.csv` is properly formatted and that it contains the latest data.
2. Submit the `submission/result.csv` file.
3. Wait for the submission to be scored.
4. Commit the changes with the submission's score in the commit message.
5. Push the changes to GitHub.
6. Download the repository as .zip via GitHub.
7. Upload the downloaded .zip file to HackerEarth.

## Approach
TBD

## Tools
I used RapidMiner Studio to do most of the work. I also used LibreOffice Calc to view the datasets and Visual Studio Code to do some manual editing on the given datasets.

## Relevant source code
As written above, all the relevant "code" is in the "Workspace" process in the RapidMiner Studio repository.
